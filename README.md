- 👋 Hi, I’m @0x7694C9
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development, Music, and Trolling.
- 🌱 My main priority is learning Java, since I primarily develop for a Minecraft server. But will soon move to other languages.
- 💞️ I mainly work by myself, but assistance is appreciated but not required.
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord: 0x7694c9. That's it.
